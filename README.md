# Email_Sending_App
The Email Sending App is a Spring Boot-based application that enables users to send emails efficiently using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This project is designed to simplify email communication by providing a REST API that integrates with an email service provider (such as Gmail, SMTP servers, or third-party APIs like SendGrid). It ensures secure, reliable, and fast email delivery with support for attachments, HTML formatting, and customized templates.
